- autocomplete=off everywhere
- enable deleting a transaction
- segment the ledger book my accounting_period (monthly typically)
  - that could mean I'll have to redeclare opening balances on each new period.
- enable listing the accounts
  - CRUD
- enable choosing the target account for the ledger's "point of view"
- maybe later: allow reordering the ledger entries via click and drag
  - if I do that, then only show the date for the user
  - the app's tz will always be UTC
- cleanup /ui, KISS
- implement graphs to show the balance's evolution
- maybe allow selecting accounts to appear in the "balance cards"
  - then allow cycling through the accounts, carousel-style
  - then, ledger view will be from the "first" card's account point of view
- then later, allow importing OFX files
  - make sure to detect re-imports (the same tx being imported twice should be
    detected)
