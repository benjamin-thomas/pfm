## How we should work

Let's work in very small batches in this project.

I'll give you auto-write commit, but then I want you to stop early and often, at each "major" and logical step. I'll review your code, probably make adjustments, and git commit, then we'll carry on.

Always run `npm run test:all` before getting back to me (and make sure teh code compiles!). If it's good, add a "tada" emoji.

In case of troubles, always refer to the working approach here: ~/code/explore/purescript/ps-fullstack3

## Goal

The goal is to replace my Elm+Haskell app (a work in progress), with a fullstack PureScript solution.

This should provide less friction when crossing the frontend/backend worlds.


## JS code style

- always favor using arrow functions
